The `class Backend` of the NAM app provides [global variables](../back/backend-global-variables.html)
 and [functions](../back/backend-functions.html)
 which should be used for tasks which aren't visible in the UI. Examples are: requests to the server, user specific information and important reuseable data. The tables in the application are filled through the [array-](../back/backend-arraycontroller.html) and [dictionary controllers](../back/backend-arraycontroller.html).
