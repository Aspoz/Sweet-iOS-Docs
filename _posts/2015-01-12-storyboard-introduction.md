The stoaryboard is used to easily set up the application. The advances of using a storyboard are that it's possible to see which screens your working on without running your application. This made things more clear while learning xcode. 

Downsides are that you can't see some 'magic' things, such as segues. Also, styling is now seperated in some cases, attributes inspector and programmaticly styling things have to work together. 

This made clear that every possible styling update(colors, texts, etc.) from now on, should be done in code (if possible).
