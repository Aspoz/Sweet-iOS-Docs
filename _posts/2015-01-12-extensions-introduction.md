To keep the `Backend` clean from frontend functions without losing the power of global functions that can be accessed from the `ViewControllers` and `Views`, we make use of extensions. These functions will be described per extension type. You can access the [UIColor](extensions-uicolor.html), [UIView](extensions-uiview.html), [UITextView](extensions-uitextview.html) and [String](extensions-string.html) extensions on the corresponding pages in the menu.
